The Internet has been driving tremendous change in the world since this century,
while continuously changing and evolving on its own. 
Formed a wave after wave of the Internet revolution.
This course teaches the concepts and general principles of 
the underlying networks of the Internet.

Through this course, we will learn about the structure and components of computer 
networks, packet switching, and layer architectures as well as a variety of 
network applications. 
And familiar with the various protocols of computer network, 
explore issues of network security.

## 3 git, github and gitee

In this course we will employ git as project management tool for teaching, training 
and excercising. We highly recommand that our students use github as daily used 
remote repositories for course learning, for the convenience of resource 
searching and management from the whole github programmer's community. In the 
meanwhile you may use gitee as a main backup source of remote repositories.

From [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
you may download the most recent version of git and then make default installation.

### 3.1 SSH Connection

Use git tools to manage projects, often using SSH to connect to code repositories. 
How to install win11 SSH client please refer:

[Install SSH on Win11](git/ssh_client.md)

Generate and use ssh-key:

[Please refer to ssh-key](git/ssh_gitee.md)


### 3.2 Push to Remote Repositories

The method of synchronizing the local repository to 
github and gitee can be found at:

[synchronizing the local repository to gitee and github](git/gitee_n_github.md)

### [3.3 frequently used git commands](git/frequentlyUsed.md)

### [3.4 New git preview features](git/preview_features.md)


## Academic Integrity

Grading in this course is intended to be fair and objectively measure your
